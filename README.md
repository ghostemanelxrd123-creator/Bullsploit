BullSploit is a modular, high-performance penetration testing ecosystem designed for automated network reconnaissance and security research. The framework provides a robust environment for developing, managing, and executing security-centric modules.

### 🏗 Technical Architecture

The framework is built upon a modular micro-kernel design, prioritizing scalability and runtime stability.

•  Dynamic Module Introspection: Implements importlib for runtime dependency injection and module management.

•  AST-based Validation: Utilizes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) library for pre-execution syntax verification, ensuring core stability against malformed module code.

•  Concurrency Engine: Optimized for I/O-bound tasks using the threading library, supporting high-concurrency network operations (3000+ threads).

•  Unified Argument Parser: A specialized parameter management system providing strict type validation for user-defined inputs.

### 📂 Module Classification

Functional units are categorized into three distinct domains:
## 🛠 Installation & Deployment

The framework requires an isolated Python environment. An automated deployment script is provided for Linux-based systems.
